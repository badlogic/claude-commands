# Todo Implementation System

Human-agent collaborative workflow for transforming vague todos into implemented features in ~150 LOC of Markdown.

This workflow is meant for engineers who want to stay in control of and informed about their code base, using agents to do the tedious work, and their brain for the hard parts.

**Problems this solves**:
- Breaking vague ideas into well defined problem descriptions and concrete implementation steps
- Preventing agents from making unauthorized changes or expanding scope
- Efficient context usage by providing agents only task-relevant information
- Full isolation of feature work using git worktrees
- Resuming interrupted work without losing context or progress
- Traceable feature development history with meaningful commits and pull request

**Problems this does not solve**:
- "Claude, build me Uber for dogs"
- Slop in your code base generated by an army of unsupervised agents in the cloud
- Merge conflicts

**Why this approach**:
- Zero dependencies, pure markdown + git + shell commands
- Easy to understand, modify, and transfer between any coding agent
- No vendor lock-in, maximum transparency and simplicity

## How it works
Just read [`todo.md`](./todo.md). It's 150 LOC of Markdown. You can do it!

At its core, the workflow is a state machine that guides the agent through distinct phases:
- **`INIT`**: Describes the project and checks for leftover work.
- **`SELECT`**: The human chooses a task from `todos/todos.md`.
- **`REFINE`**: The agent and human collaborate to create a detailed implementation plan.
- **`IMPLEMENT`**: The agent executes the plan, with the human approving each step.
- **`COMMIT`**: The work is finalized into a clean pull request.

## Installation

### Claude Code
1. Put `todo.md` in `~/.claude/commands` (global) or `project/.claude/commands` (project)
2. In your project: `mkdir -p todos && echo "- add dark mode" > todos/todos.md`

### Other agents
1. Put `todo.md` in a location accessible to your agent
2. In your project: `mkdir -p todos && echo "- add dark mode" > todos/todos.md`

## Usage
The core idea is to load `todo.md` as a system prompt or initial instruction for your agent. The agent will then run the workflow defined in the prompt and guide you through it.

### Claude Code
In your project root directory
```bash
# The --dangerously-skip-permissions flag allows the agent to execute
# shell commands (git, cd, mkdir) as defined in the workflow without
# user approval. Omitting it will require you to manually approve
# every shell command.
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "/todo"
```

Claude will guide you through the workflow.

### Other agents
1. Run your agent in your project root directory
2. Give the contents of `todo.md` to the agent as the first user message

The agent will guide you through the workflow.
